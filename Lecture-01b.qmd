# Samples, populations and study design

> "To call in a statistician after the experiment has been done may be no more than asking him to perform a post-mortem examination: he may be able to say what the experiment died of." 

-- Sir Ronald Fisher

## Revision

- **Population**: the entire group of individuals or instances about whom we want to draw conclusions.
- **Sample**: a *subset* of the population.

::: {.fragment .incremental}
### Parameter
- A numerical **measure** that describes an aspect of a population.
- *Not known* (unless we sample the entire population), therefore we **estimate** them using a **sample statistic**.
- **What information does the *sample statistic* give about the *population parameter*, and how reliable is that information?**
:::

<!-- ::: {.fragment .incremental} -->
<!-- ### Uncertainty -->

<!-- - Populations are inherently variable - **random variation**. -->
<!-- - Repeated samples from the same population will give different sample statistics - **sampling variation**. -->
<!-- - **We want to be able to quantify this uncertainty in our estimates.** -->

# Designs: why do we care?

> (On a failed experiment)
>
> *That is not an experiment you have there, that is an experience*.

-- Sir Ronald Fisher

## Measure everything?

Why not measure every individual in a population, instead of designing a sampling strategy?

::: {.fragment}
- **Impractical** to measure every individual in a population, and some populations are *infinite* -- practically impossible to measure all.
- **Costly** to measure every individual in a population -- time, money, resources.
- **Destructive** in many biological cases e.g. to measure the age of a plant, you may have to cut it down, so you want to respect the loss of life.
:::

::: {.fragment}
::: {.callout-important}
Importantly, sampling from a population -- when done correctly -- can give a **good estimate of the population parameter**, give or take some *uncertainty*. Apart from a census study, there should be no reason to measure every individual in a population.
:::
:::

## Sampling designs

Can be done in two general ways:

1. **Observational study**
2. **Controlled experiment**

When designed correctly, both can give us a good estimate of the population parameter while saving time and resources.

::: {.fragment}
### Considerations

- Samples should be **representative** of the population and **randomly** selected.
- **Bias** can be introduced if the sampling design is not carefully considered.
- **Confounding** variables can also affect the results.

We will explore these concepts in more detail over the next few weeks.
:::

## Observational study vs. controlled experiment

| Aspect | Observational study | Controlled experiment |
|--------|---------------------|-----------------------|
| **Control** | No control over the variables of interest - **Mensurative** and **Absolute** | Control over the variables of interest - **Comparative** and **Manipulative** |
| **Causation** | Cannot establish causation, but perhaps **association** | Can establish **causation** |
| **Feasibility** | Can be done in many cases | May be destructive and cannot always be done |


## Other designs exist

- **Theoretical models** (e.g. mathematical models): useful for understanding the system, often used in ecology and epidemiology. No data collection.
- **Simulation studies**: useful for figuring out experimental design and understanding the system. Some data collection may be involved to inform the model.
- **Case studies**: Similar to observational studies, but often with a single case! Useful for understanding a unique situation, often used in medicine and psychology. No control over the variables of interest and sometimes no statistical inference is made.

### What is the best way to sample?

- Sequestering carbon in soil is a potential way to mitigate climate change, and provides nutrients and resilience to crops. Worth $50/tonne if measured.
- Collecting soil samples is costly and time-consuming, about $100/sample.
- We want a way to estimate the soil carbon content in a large area - some kind of **summary statistic**.

:::
::::


## Summary statistics

::: {.fragment}
### Central tendency

- **Mean**: the average of the data.
- **Median**: the middle value of the data.
- **Mode**: the most frequent value in the data.

:::

::: {.fragment}
### Variability

- **Range**: the difference between the largest and smallest value.
- **Interquartile range**: the difference between the 75th and 25th percentile.
- **Variance**: the average of the squared differences from the mean.
- **Standard deviation**: the square root of the variance.

:::

# Mean and standard deviation

> Statistics always remind me of the fellow who drowned in a river whose average depth was only three feet (\~0.9 m).

-- *Woody Hayes, American football coach*

## Mean and standard deviation

- The most *common* measures of central tendency and variability.
- Works well for **symmetric** and **unimodal** distributions, therefore the assumption is that the data is normally distributed.

::: {.fragment}

```{r}
#| code-fold: true

library(tidyverse)

ggplot(
    data = tibble(x = seq(0, 20, 0.01)),
    aes(x = x)
) +
    stat_function(
        fun = dchisq,
        args = list(df = 5),
        color = "purple", size = 1
    ) +
    # add vertical lines for mean, median and mode
    geom_vline(xintercept = 5, color = "red", linetype = "dashed") +
    geom_vline(xintercept = 4.35, color = "blue", linetype = "dashed") +
    geom_vline(xintercept = 3, color = "seagreen", linetype = "dashed") +
    # label the lines
    annotate("text", x = 3.6, y = 0.06, label = "Mode", color = "seagreen") +
    annotate("text", x = 5.6, y = 0.09, label = "Mean", color = "red") +
    annotate("text", x = 5.1, y = 0.03, label = "Median", color = "blue") +
    labs(
        x = "x",
        y = "Density"
    ) +
    theme_bw()
```

- Not quite useful for **skewed** or **multimodal** distributions.

## Arithmetric mean

> Sum of all the values, divided by the number of values.

::: {.fragment}
### Population mean
If we measure the entire population, the population mean $\mu$ is:

$$ \mu = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} y_i}{N} $$

where $y_i$ is the $i$th observation and $N$ is the number of individuals in the population.
:::
::: {.fragment}
### Sample mean
Sample mean is based on the same principle, but we use $n$ instead of $N$ and $\bar{y}$ instead of $\mu$.

$$ \bar{y} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i}{n} $$

where $y_i$ is the $i$th observation and $n$ is the number of sample observations.
:::

## Variance

::: {.fragment}

> The average of the squared differences from the mean.

:::

::: {.fragment}
#### Population variance:
$$\sigma^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i - \mu)^2}{N}$$

#### Sample variance
$$s^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \bar{y})^2}{n-1}$$

:::

## Standard deviation

::: {.fragment}
> The square root of the variance.

:::

::: {.fragment}
#### Population standard deviation

$$\sigma = \sqrt{\sigma^2} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i - \mu)^2}{N}}$$

#### Sample standard deviation

$$s = \sqrt{s^2} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \bar{y})^2}{n-1}}$$

:::


## Why $n-1$?

- The sample variance and standard deviation calculations use $n-1$ in the denominator, not $n$.
- This is called [**Bessel's correction**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bessel%27s_correction).
- It is used to correct the bias in the estimation of the population variance from a sample, **as $n$ number of observations have $n-1$ independent residuals**.
  - *You will learn more about this -- and degrees of freedom -- in the next module*.


## Soil carbon

**Sampling design**: Soil carbon content was measured at 7 locations across the area. The amount at each location was 48, 56, 90, 78, 86, 71, 42 tonnes per hectare (t/ha).

::: {.fragment}
```{r}
soil <- c(48, 56, 90, 78, 86, 71, 42)

```

::: {.fragment}
### Calculating mean and standard deviation

```{r}
mean(soil)
sd(soil)
```

:::

::: {.fragment .callout-tip}
## What do these numbers tell us? How confident are we that they represent the entire area?

:::

# The sampling distribution

## Distributions

- The **population distribution** is the distribution of all the individuals in the population.
- From the population distribution, we can sample it to get a **sample distribution**.
- If we summarise the sample distribution, we get a single value - the **sample statistic**.
- The sample statistic is part of a **sampling distribution**, based on the idea that given unlimited resources, we could sample the population many times and calculate the sample statistic each time.

::: {.fragment}

### Example

::: {.incremental}
- We want to measure the mean height of trees in a forest, which contains 1000 trees. **1000 possible height values make up the population distribution**.
- We can't measure all the trees, so we take a sample of 100 trees and calculate the average height.**100 height values make up the sample distribution**.
- The mean height of the 100 trees is calculated. This is the **sample statistic** - a single value for the sample.
- To make up the **sampling distribution**, we could repeat the process of taking a sample of 100 trees and calculating the mean height many times...

## Distributions - visualised

![Population, sample and sampling distributions. [Source](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Population-Sample-and-Sampling-Distributions_fig2_267837095).](images/distributions.png){#fig-distributions fig-align="center"}


## How can distributions help us answer the question?

> What information does the *sample statistic* give about the *population parameter*, and how reliable is that information?

::: {.fragment}
We need to standardise the sample statistic to the *number of observations* in the sample.
:::

::: {.fragment}
### Standard error

$$SE = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$$

where $s$ is the sample standard deviation and $n$ is the number of observations in the sample.

:::

::: {.incremental}
- The standard deviation value is *standardised* to the number of observations in the sample.
- Tells us how much the sample statistic varies from sample to sample, i.e. **how well we know the mean**.
- If standard error is "small", we are more confident in the sample statistic -- **more on this next week**.
:::

## Effect of sample size

```{r}
#| code-fold: true

library(tidymodels)
library(patchwork)
set.seed(642)

heights <- tibble(heights = rnorm(1000, 1.99, 1))
popmean <- mean(heights$heights)
sample_sizes <- c(2, 5, 25, 100)
n <- length(sample_sizes)

heights <- tibble(heights = rgamma(1000, shape = 2, scale = 1))
sample_sizes <- c(2, 5, 25, 100)
n <- length(sample_sizes)

plots <- lapply(sample_sizes, function(size) {
    df <- heights |>
        rep_sample_n(size = size, reps = 2000) |>
        group_by(replicate) |>
        summarise(xbar = mean(heights))

    mean_xbar <- mean(df$xbar)

    ggplot(df, aes(x = xbar)) +
        geom_histogram(fill = "orangered", alpha = 0.5, bins = 50) +
        geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean_xbar), color = "blue", linetype = "dashed") +
        geom_text(aes(x = mean_xbar, label = sprintf("%.2f", mean_xbar), y = Inf), hjust = -0.1, vjust = 2, color = "blue") +
        ggtitle(paste0("Sample Size: ", size)) +
        xlab("Mean height (m)") +
        xlim(-3, 8) +
        theme_bw()
})
wrap_plots(plots)
```


- Increased sample size leads to a more accurate estimate of the population mean, reflected by the **narrower distribution** of the sample mean, which is captured by the **standard error**.

## Effect of variability

```{r}
#| code-fold: true

set.seed(1221)

# Define a function to generate ggplot objects
generate_plot <- function(sd) {
    data <- rnorm(500, 1.99, sd)
    p <- ggplot(data = tibble(x = data), aes(x = x)) +
        geom_histogram(fill = "orangered", alpha = 0.5, bins = 50) +
        ggtitle(paste("SD =", sd)) +
        xlim(-100, 100) +
        theme_bw()
    return(p)
}

# Apply the function to a list of standard deviations
sds <- c(3, 6, 15, 25)
plots <- lapply(sds, generate_plot)

# Wrap the plots
wrap_plots(plots)
```

- Increased variability leads to a wider distribution of the sample mean (i.e. less precision), which is *also* reflected by the **standard error**.

# Central limit theorem

> I know of scarcely anything so apt to impress the imagination as the **wonderful form of cosmic order** expressed by the Central Limit Theorem. The law would have been personified by the Greeks and deified, if they had known of it.”

-- Sir Francis Galton, 1889, Natural Inheritance* (emphasis added)


## CLT

- A fundamental theorem in statistics.
- Regardless of the shape of the population distribution, the sampling distribution of the **sample mean** will be approximately normally distributed **if the sample size is large enough**.
- Because of this, we can make predictions about the population by assuming that the sampling distribution is normally distributed -- **a core assumption in many statistical tests**.

## Example


```{r}
#| classes: custom4060
#| output-location: column

set.seed(239)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
# Generate a skewed distribution
skewed <- tibble(
    x = rgamma(1000, shape = 2, scale = 1)
)

# plot in ggplot2
ggplot(data = skewed, aes(x = x)) +
    geom_histogram(
        fill = "orangered",
        alpha = 0.5, bins = 50
    ) +
    xlab("Height (m)") +
    theme_bw()
```

- Skewed population distribution for tree heights.
- We want to estimate the mean height of the trees in the forest.

## 1 sample (no summary statistic)


```{r}
#| classes: custom4060
#| output-location: column

skewed |>
    infer::rep_sample_n(
        size = 1,
        reps = 1000
    ) |>
    group_by(replicate) |>
    summarise(xbar = mean(x)) |>
    ggplot(aes(x = xbar)) +
    geom_density(
        fill = "orangered",
        alpha = 0.5, bins = 50
    ) +
    xlim(0, 10) +
    xlab("Mean height (m)") +
    theme_bw()
```

- A single random sample per calculated mean, repeated 1000 times, gives us a distribution of sample means that will likely mirrors the population distribution.

## 2 samples


```{r}
#| classes: custom4060
#| output-location: column

skewed |>
    infer::rep_sample_n(
        size = 2,
        reps = 1000
    ) |>
    group_by(replicate) |>
    summarise(xbar = mean(x)) |>
    ggplot(aes(x = xbar)) +
    geom_density(
        fill = "orangered",
        alpha = 0.5, bins = 50
    ) +
    xlim(0, 10) +
    xlab("Mean height (m)") +
    theme_bw()
```

- Two random samples per calculated mean, repeated 1000 times.
- The distribution of sample means is starting to look more like a normal distribution.


## 5 samples

```{r}
#| classes: custom4060
#| output-location: column

skewed |>
    infer::rep_sample_n(
        size = 5,
        reps = 1000
    ) |>
    group_by(replicate) |>
    summarise(xbar = mean(x)) |>
    ggplot(aes(x = xbar)) +
    geom_density(
        fill = "orangered",
        alpha = 0.5, bins = 50
    ) +
    xlim(0, 10) +
    xlab("Mean height (m)") +
    theme_bw()
```

- Five random samples per calculated mean, repeated 1000 times.
- Not only is the distribution of sample means starting to look more like a normal distribution, but the standard error is also getting smaller.

## 30 samples

```{r}
#| classes: custom4060
#| output-location: column

skewed |>
    infer::rep_sample_n(
        size = 30,
        reps = 1000
    ) |>
    group_by(replicate) |>
    summarise(xbar = mean(x)) |>
    ggplot(aes(x = xbar)) +
    geom_density(
        fill = "orangered",
        alpha = 0.5, bins = 50
    ) +
    xlim(0, 10) +
    xlab("Mean height (m)") +
    theme_bw()
```

- Thirty random samples per calculated mean, repeated 1000 times.
- The distribution of sample means is very close to a normal distribution.

## 50 samples

```{r}
#| classes: custom4060
#| output-location: column

skewed |>
    infer::rep_sample_n(
        size = 50,
        reps = 1000
    ) |>
    group_by(replicate) |>
    summarise(xbar = mean(x)) |>
    ggplot(aes(x = xbar)) +
    geom_density(
        fill = "orangered",
        alpha = 0.5, bins = 50
    ) +
    xlim(0, 10) +
    xlab("Mean height (m)") +
    theme_bw()
```

- Fifty random samples per calculated mean, repeated 1000 times.
- **How many samples is enough?**

## How many samples is enough?

::: {.incremental}
- If $n$ is large enough, the sampling distribution of the sample mean will be approximately normally distributed - **allowing us to use the normal distribution to make inferences about the population!**
- **How large is large enough?**
  - **Rule of thumb**: $n \geq 30$ is often used, but this is not a hard and fast rule.
  - **Depends on the population distribution**: if the population distribution is normal, the sampling distribution will be normal for any $n$.
  - **Depends on the variability**: if the population distribution is highly variable, a larger $n$ is needed to get a normal sampling distribution.
